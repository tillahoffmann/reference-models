  Outcomes of CBS News polls from the 10 days immediately preceeding the 1988 US presidential
  election described on pages 4--5 of {doc}`arm`. Each respondent was asked if they preferred George
  Bush (`y = 1`) or Michael Dukakis (`y = 0`). Demographic information includes four age and
  education categories, gender of the respondent, and whether they are Black. The respondents'
  residential state and corresponding
  [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States) are also available.

  States have the same indices as in {ref}`data-presidential` but states 2 (AK) and 12 (HI) have no
  data. State 9 (DC) is not present in {ref}`data-presidential`.

  The data were obtained from
  [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/a4cf8b7/ARM/Ch.14/election88_full.data.R)
  and converted to CSV for interoperability.
