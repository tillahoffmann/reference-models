  Data on the effect of coaching programs on Stochastic Aptitude Test (Verbal) in each of eight high
  schools described in Section 5.5 of {doc}`bda3`. In each school, the estimated coaching effect and
  its standard error were obtained by an analysis of covariance adjustment (that is, a linear
  regression was performed of SAT-V on treatment group, using PSAT-M and PSAT-V as control
  variables) appropriate for a completely randomized experiment. A separate regression was estimated
  for each school. Data were obtained from table 1 of
  [10.2307/1164617](https://doi.org/10.2307/1164617).
