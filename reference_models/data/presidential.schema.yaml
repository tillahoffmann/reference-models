  Data on U.S. Presidential elections used in Section 15.2 and described in Table 15.1 of "Bayesian
  Data Analysis". The data were obtained from
  http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/presidential.asc and converted to CSV for
  interoperability. This schema is based on the embedded data description and table 15.2. Regions in
  the below `definitions` use state indices in alphabetic order starting at 1.

  The value of the regional variable r1 ('South') is 0 in non-Southern states. In Southern states,
  r1 = D - R, where D=1 if the Democratic candidate for President is a Southerner, and R=1 if the
  Republican candidate for President is a Southerner. We set D=1 in 1964, 1976, 1980, 1992; and R=1
  in 1964. For the purposes of this variable (and also the variable r2, ('South in 1964'), Southern
  states are AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA (but not KY or OK).
