  Data on U.S. Presidential elections used in Section 15.2 and described in Table 15.1 of
  {doc}`bda3`. The data were obtained from
  [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/presidential.asc) and converted to CSV for
  interoperability. This schema is based on the embedded data description and table 15.2. Regions in
  the below `metadata` use state indices in alphabetic order of the *name* of the state (rather
  than it's two-letter code) starting at 1. Compared with the
  [region assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States) of the US
  Census Bureau, the following states in the South have been moved to the North East: MD, DE, WV
  (presumably to balance the sizes of regions).

  The value of the regional variable `r1` ('South') is 0 in non-Southern states. In Southern states,
  `r1 = 1` if the Democratic candidate for President is a Southerner, and `r1 = -1` if the
  Republican candidate for President is a Southerner. We set `r1 = 1` in 1964, 1976, 1980, 1992 and
  `r1 = -1` in 1964. For the purposes of this variable (and also the variable `r2`, 'South in 1964'),
  Southern states are AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA (but not KY or OK).
