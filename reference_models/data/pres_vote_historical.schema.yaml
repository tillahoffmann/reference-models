  Data on U.S. Presidential elections used by Andrew Gelman
  [to forecast US presidential elections](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/04/31935/)
  in 2020, 2024, and 2028 for the New York Times (see
  [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230324105441/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/campaign-stops/red-pennsylvania-and-blue-georgia.html)
  for the article). He notes that the model is "'dumb'" in that it uses nothing more than past vote
  totals and a forecast of the 2016 vote" (in contrast to {ref}`data-presidential` which also
  includes covariates such as economic performance). State groups are extracted from Andrew's blog
  post. DC is included in the dataset but not used in the definition of regions. Data were obtained
  from

  and converted to CSV for interoperability.
