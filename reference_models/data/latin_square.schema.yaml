  Yield of plots of [millet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet) in grams arranged in a 5 by 5
  [latin square experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square) discussed on page 292 of
  {doc}`arm`. Data were extracted from figure 13.11. The primary source is table 14.10.2 on page
  270 of "Statistical Methods" by Snedecor and Cochran (1989). Treatments correspond to different
  spacings of plants (treatment A corresponds to 2 inch spacing, B to 4 inches, etc.). Rows and
  columns correspond to physical space and their order is important because "there is often a
  gradient in fertility running parallel to one side of the field and sometimes gradients running
  parallel to both sides." (Snedecor and Cochran, p. 268).
