  Prosocial behavior (or lack thereof) among seven chimpanzees described on page 325 of
  {doc}`rethinking`; the primary source is
  [10.1038/nature04243](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04243). In this suite of experiments, a focal
  chimpanzee (actor) is presented with two levers that can be pulled. One lever will deliver an item
  of food to the actor only. The other lever will also deliver an item of food to the other side of
  the table which may or may not be occupied by another chimpanzee (recipient). This setup
  was repeated in six blocks (corresponding to different days) for all pairs of seven chimpanzees
  (both as actor and recipient). Each experiment *with* a recipient was interleaved with an
  experiment *without* a recipient. The dataset thus comprises
  `[6 blocks] * [7 actors] * ([6 recipients] + [6 empty seats]) = 504` experiments. The motivation
  for the experiments was to assess whether the chimpanzees would change their behavior if a
  recipient is present, e.g., choosing the prosocial option that delivers food to a fellow
  chimpanzee.

  The data were obtained from
  [here](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/2f01a9c/data/chimpanzees.csv), and this
  schema is based on
  [this documentation](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/2f01a9c/man/chimpanzees.Rd).
  In this dataset, the `recipient` identifier has been re-coded by subtracting `1` as suggested by
  [rmcelreath/rethinking#340](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/issues/340).
