  Prosocial behavior (or lack thereof) among seven chimpanzees described on page 325 of
  {doc}`rethinking`; the primary source is
  [10.1038/nature04243](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04243). The data were obtained from
  [here](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/2f01a9c/data/chimpanzees.csv), and this
  schema is based on
  [this documentation](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/2f01a9c/man/chimpanzees.Rd).
  In this dataset, the `recipient` identifier has been re-coded by subtracting `1` as discussed in
  [rmcelreath/rethinking#340](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/issues/340).
type: array
# There are seven chimpanzees who can be paired as actor and possible recipient in 6 * 7 = 42
# different ways. Each experiment *with* a recipient is interleaved with an experiment *without* a
# recipient, giving rise to another 42 configurations for a total of 84. This setup is repeated over
# the course of six days for a total of 6 * 84 = 504 records.
